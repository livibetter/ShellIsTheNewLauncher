                                      x
                            
                        X program launcher in terminal


x is a program launcher, written in POSIX shell with Bash completion for 
command names. It's for people who have shell ready to use in terminal window.

Although x is for launching X programs from terminal, but in code, it has 
nothing tied to the X Window. It's just and simply a shell script to ensure no 
noise or interruptions to the terminal after executing the command.


                                    USAGE


$ x comman<TAB>


                               (UN)INSTALLTION


Use make command to install, the default path is /usr/local, you can override 
with PREFIX=/path/to. For $HOME installation, run:

    $ make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local

Two files are installed:

- The x command   to $PREFIX/bin
- Bash completion to $PREFIX/share/bash-completion/completions

To uninstall, in the same case, run:

    $ make uninstall PREFIX=$HOME/.local


                                 DEPENDENCIES


The only dependency is the nohup command, which can be circumvented with 
Bash's disown builtin, but that would need one more line and not be POSIX 
shell compatible.


                                   CAVEATS


1. The Bash completion for x command will get a list of commands, but not just 
   executables, but also Bash builtins and keywords, such as for and if 
   keywords. It's because complete builtin doesn't have an option for 
   executable-only.

2. Installation does not respect to $BASH_COMPLETION_USER_DIR, which takes 
   effective to load the completion scripts from since bash-completion commit 
   1d25d72 [1] (2015-02-17). It's a user-based directory and it'd be 
   complicated to mix with $PREFIX.

                                  THE NAME X


The project name is the same as the command name, x. Several names were 
considered, but they conflict with existing commands from other projects.  
Here is the list, in order:

- xr: the initial name, dubbing "x run," but there is a project named xr, 
  Crossroads Load Balancer.
- rx: reasonably like running X program, but there is a command called rx from 
  lrzsz, a communication tool for X, Y, and ZMODEM file transfer protocols.
- xx: double-tapping, but xx is also taken, some client for the F*EX service.

Finally, just "x" seems fine and perfect, the only X exists is the X11 server, 
fortunately its command name is a capital X, no conflicts.

You are welcome to contribute in anyway you like, but since the minimalistic 
approach is very much the focal point of this project, that is the initial 4
